# 3.1 Date/Time functions
These functions are used to modify or extract pieces from a column that has a date or time data type. MySQL [Documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/date-and-time-functions.html) covers the various functions that are available. Here are a few examples:

### Example
Use the ```month()``` function to adjust the \`from_date\` column so that we just show the month number, rather than the entire date.
```sql
SELECT emp_no, month(from_date) 
FROM salaries;

12345, 12
23456, 4
23343, 3
...
```

### Example 
Use the ```monthname()``` function to adjust the \`from_date\` column so that we just show the name of the month, rather than the entire date.
```sql
SELECT emp_no, monthname(from_date) 
FROM salaries;

12345, December
23456, April
23343, March
...
```
### Example
Adjust the \`from_date\` column so that we just show the month name, rather than the entire date, and then use that month name as the group/category for a count() aggregate function.
```sql
SELECT monthname(from_date), count(*)
FROM salaries
GROUP BY 1;

April, 342
December, 329
February, 438
...

```
### Example
Now sort the above rows so they are in "time order" (January, February, March...). The solution is to order by the numeric month value which now must become part of our query as follows:
```sql
SELECT year(from_date), month(from_date), monthname(from_date), count(*) 
FROM salaries
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
ORDER BY 1, month(from_date);
```
