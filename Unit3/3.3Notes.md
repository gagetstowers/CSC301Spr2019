# 3.3 Numeric functions
There are many SQL functions that work on numeric data. Some of the most commonly used are ```rand()``` and ```round()```. You should familiarize yourself with the options available. Browse through the [Documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/numeric-functions.html) and see what kind of functions are available.

The following will take the salary column for each employee and divide it by 2080 (the number of hours in a year) and then round to 2 decimal places. This produces an hourly wage! 
```sql
SELECT emp_no, round(salary/2080,2) 
FROM salaries;
```

Let's imagine we wanted to give each person a 4-digit pin, along with their email address. Perhaps the rand() function can help. First we test out how rand() works by generating a random number:
```sql
SELECT lower(concat(left(first_name,1), last_name, '@company.com')), rand() 
FROM employees;
```

It turns out that ```rand()``` gives a random number between 0 and 1. So, we will need to multiply the random number by 10000 so we have 4 positive digits, then we round the number.
```sql
SELECT lower(concat(left(first_name,1), last_name, '@company.com')), round(rand()*10000,0) 
FROM employees;
```
But because that method sometimes results in numbers that are shorter than 4 digits long (since leading zeroes are dropped from numbers), we can left-pad with zeroes if the number is fewer than 4 digits:
```sql
SELECT lower(concat(left(first_name,1), last_name, '@company.com')), lpad(round(rand()*10000,0),4,'0') 
FROM employees;
```
