# 3.3 Numeric functions
There are many SQL functions that work on numeric data. Some of the most commonly used are ```rand()``` and ```round()```. You should familiarize yourself with the options available. Browse through the [Documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/numeric-functions.html) and see what kind of functions are available.

The following will take the salary column for each employee and divide it by 2080 (the number of hours in a year) and then round to 2 decimal places. This produces an hourly wage! 
```sql
SELECT emp_no, round(salary/2080,2) as 'Salary'
FROM salaries
```
Results:
```
```
emp_no  Salary:
------  ------
10001   28.90
10001   29.86
10001   31.77
10001   32.02
```
Let's imagine we wanted to give each person a 4-digit pin, along with their email address. Perhaps the `rand()` function can help. First we test out how `rand()` works by generating a random number:
```sql
SELECT lower(concat(left(first_name,1), last_name, '@company.com')), rand() 
FROM employees;
```
Results:
```
Email                   rand()
-------                 -------
gfacello@company.com    0.8977140084819067
bsimmel@company.com     0.5182985183953294
pbamford@company.com    0.8983505972645717
ckoblick@company.com    0.9368574618705152
```
It turns out that `rand()` gives a random number between 0 and 1. So, we will need to multiply the random number by 10000 so we have 4 positive digits, then we round the number.
```sql
SELECT lower(concat(left(first_name,1), last_name, '@company.com')) as 'Email', 
       round(rand()*10000,0) as 'PIN'
FROM employees;
```
Results:
```
Email                 PIN
------                -----
gfacello@company.com  9563
bsimmel@company.com   487   <-- uh oh, looks like this one started with 0!
pbamford@company.com  8746
ckoblick@company.com  7269
```
But because that method sometimes results in numbers that are shorter than 4 digits long (since leading zeroes are dropped from numbers), we can left-pad with zeroes if the number is fewer than 4 digits:
```sql
SELECT lower(concat(left(first_name,1), last_name, '@company.com')) as 'Email', 
       lpad(round(rand()*10000,0),4,'0') as 'PIN' 
FROM employees;
```
Results:
```
Email                 PIN
------                -----
gfacello@company.com  9563
bsimmel@company.com   0487  <-- all fixed
pbamford@company.com  8746
ckoblick@company.com  7269
```
