## 3.4 Data manipulation commands
These commands change or show the data inside the database. Examples include ```SELECT```, ```INSERT```, ```UPDATE```, ```DELETE```
### 3.4.0 SELECT
Displays data inside a table. We began to use these in Unit 2, and they are the most common command we see in the RDBMS.
### 3.4.1 INSERT
Adds a new record (row) into a table. There are two formats for the ```INSERT``` command in MySQL:

#### INSERT Version 1 - Extended
With a column list (sometimes called "extended inserts"). Example:
```sql
INSERT INTO mytable(first, last) 
VALUES ('Mary', 'Smith');
```
The **advantage** to this format is that it is complete and leaves very little room for mistakes. The **disadvantage** is that it is slightly longer to write and will require more bytes to store as a file or send across the network than the alternative (below).
#### INSERT Version 1 - Extended & Multiple 
You can do multiple INSERT statements one, as follows:
```sql
INSERT INTO mytable (first, middle, last) 
VALUES('Mary','W','Smith'),
      ('Richard','Q','Williams'),
      ('Tran','L','Phan');
```
#### INSERT Version 2 - Short
Without a column list. Example:
```sql
INSERT INTO mytable 
VALUES ('Mary','Smith');
```
The **advantage** to this format is that the statement is shorter. The **disadvantage** is that you must enter data for ALL columns, and you must have them in the correct order. 

### 3.4.2 INSERT - SELECT
You can use the return values from a ```SELECT``` command to populate a new table. Here is an example where we want to create a new table of just the non-deceased pets:

```sql
INSERT into new_pets (petID, petName, petBirthDate) 
  SELECT id, name, bd 
  FROM old_pets
  WHERE deceased ='false';
```
Sometimes we need to ```SELECT``` from one schema and ```INSERT``` into a table in another schema. We can prefix the *other* table with the correct schema name. For example, suppose we have data in a schema called *test* that we want to move into a new schema called *production*:
```sql
INSERT into production.mytable (foo, bar)
  SELECT foo, bar
  FROM test.anothertable
  WHERE status = "ready";
```
### 3.4.3 UPDATE 
The ```UPDATE``` command changes the data in an existing row for some particular column(s). 
Example: Oh no, the student is listed as "Maria" but her name is really "Mary":
```sql
UPDATE mytable 
SET first_name = 'Mary'
WHERE student_id = 90897;
```
Example: Change all F grades to a D:
```sql
UPDATE basket_weaving_grades 
SET student_grade = 'D'
WHERE student_grade = 'F';
```
Usually we like to have a ```WHERE``` clause in an ```UPDATE``` statement. If we have no WHERE clause, then the statement is applied to ALL rows.That might be what you want, but on the other hand, it might not! Be careful.

```sql
UPDATE basket_weaving_students
SET first_name='Mary', last_name='Smith'
WHERE studentID = 99;
```
### 3.4.4 DELETE
Removes a row. 

Example: Let's remove all students who got a D or F in Basket-Weaving:
```sql
DELETE FROM basket_weaving_grades
WHERE student_grade in ('D', 'F');
```
Another format:
```sql
DELETE FROM basket_weaving_grades
WHERE student_grade = 'D'
OR student_grade = 'F';
```
What if you don't want to remove an entire row, just one or two cell values? Then you don't want ```DELETE```, you want ```UPDATE```.

```sql
-- this command sets a blank grade value whereever there was a D or F
UPDATE basket_weaving_grades
SET student_grade=''
WHERE student_grade IN ('D','F');
```
