# 3.2 String functions 
String functions work on textual data. Examples include ```concat()``` and ```substring()```, ```left()``` and ```right()```, ```trim()```, and so on. [Documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/string-functions.html)

### Example
Pull out the first_name and last_name columns, and concatenate them together with a space in between:
```sql
SELECT concat(first_name, ' ', last_name) as 'Name'
FROM employees;
```
Results:
```
Name:
------
Georgi Facello
Bezalel Simmel
Parto Bamford
Christian Koblick
```

Suppose we wanted to create email addresses for each employee. We can show how many string functions will work in concert to make this dream come true. 

First let's use `left()` to extract the first initial of the first name, then use `concat()` to concatenate it to the last name:
```sql
SELECT concat(left(first_name,1), last_name) as 'Username'
FROM employees;
```
Results:
```
Username:
--------
GFacello
BSimmel
PBamford
CKoblick
...
```

Now let's use `lower()` to add the lowercasing and add onto `concat()` with the `@company.com` extension:

```sql
SELECT lower(concat(left(first_name,1), last_name, '@company.com')) as 'Email'
FROM employees;
```
Results:
```
Email:
------
gfacello@company.com
bsimmel@company.com
pbamford@company.com
ckoblick@company.com
```
