### 2.6.3 Thinking about Efficiency
Compare the result time for the following queries as reported by PhpMyAdmin:
```sql
SELECT Continent, Region, sum(SurfaceArea) 
FROM Country 
GROUP BY 1,2;
```
--versus--
```sql
SELECT Continent, Region, sum(SurfaceArea) 
FROM Country 
GROUP BY Continent, Region;
```

Which one is reported to be faster? When does this matter? All the time or some of the time?
