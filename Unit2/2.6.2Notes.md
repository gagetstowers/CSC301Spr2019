### 2.6.2 Rules of Group By
1. Don't use "group by" unless you need it! 
2. And you will usually only need it when you're (a) doing an aggregate function (count, sum, max, etc) AND, (b) you have another column that you want to use to make categories.
3. When you group, you **must** "group by" everything else on the top line, aside from the aggregate function itself.

#### Example: forgetting to group
What happens when you leave off the group by?
```sql
SELECT Continent, sum(SurfaceArea) 
FROM Country; -- we forgot our group by
```
The fix:
```sql
SELECT Continent, sum(SurfaceArea) 
FROM Country
GROUP BY 1;
```
#### Example: forgetting to group one of the non-aggregate columns
What happens when you only group by one of the non-aggregate columns on the top line?
```sql
SELECT Continent, Region, sum(SurfaceArea) 
FROM Country 
GROUP BY 1; -- here we forgot Region!
```
The fix:
```sql
SELECT Continent, Region, sum(SurfaceArea) 
FROM Country 
GROUP BY 1,2;
```
