### 2.6.4 GROUP BY and HAVING
`HAVING` works with `GROUP BY` to reduce the list to only results meeting some threshold **after** aggregating.

#### Example: 

Without ```HAVING``` (shows all continents)
```sql
SELECT Continent, count(Code) 
FROM Country
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
With ```HAVING``` (shows only the continents with more than one country) 
```sql
SELECT Continent, count(Code) 
FROM Country
GROUP BY 1
HAVING count(Code) > 5
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
The following query will not work; why?
```sql
SELECT Continent, count(Code) 
FROM Country
GROUP BY 1
HAVING 2 > 1 -- here we try to use the column number shortcut "2" for count(Code)
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
You can't use the column number shortcuts in a HAVING clause.

Also, please only use `HAVING` when you need it. Many times you will see examples that try to use `HAVING` just like a `WHERE`. But it is **supposed** to have a different purpose. Compare its efficiency.

#### Difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING`

`WHERE` filters out rows **before** the aggregating has hapened, `HAVING` filters out rows **after** the aggregate function has been applied.

```sql
SELECT Continent, count(Code) 
FROM Country
WHERE Continent LIKE 'A%' -- this filters out Continents BEFORE counting
GROUP BY 1
HAVING count(Code) > 5 -- this filters them out AFTER counting
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
This will not work; why?
```sql
SELECT Continent, count(Code) 
FROM Country
WHERE Continent LIKE 'A%' 
  AND count(Code) > 5
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
The `count(Code) > 5` part says that a count must have happened already. Only `HAVING` can filter out stuff after a count.

This will work:
```sql
SELECT Continent, count(Code) 
FROM Country
GROUP BY 1
HAVING Continent LIKE 'A%' 
  AND count(Code) > 5
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
But that query is asking the database to count things that we know we're going to throw away anyhow, specifically Continents with names that don't start with A. Using a `WHERE` clause might make this go faster.
