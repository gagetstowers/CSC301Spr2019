# Unit 2: Getting data out of a database with SELECT

`SELECT` is probably the most useful command in the entire SQL language. 

The basic format of a useful `SELECT` command requires at minimum: (1) a list of columns, and (2) a table to pull data from. 

The format is as follows:
```sql
SELECT someColumn, AnotherColumn, AThirdColumn
FROM someTable;
```
The result of a `SELECT` will either be 0 rows (nothing matched the query) or some number of rows that did match.

If you want to display ALL the columns in a table, you can use an asterisk to mean "all":
```sql
SELECT *
FROM someTable;
```
If you want to leave out duplicates, you can use `DISTINCT`:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT firstname
FROM sometable;
```
You can also use math operators on the values in the column line:

```sql
SELECT price, price*.07, price+(price*.07)/100
FROM hotel_rooms;
```
