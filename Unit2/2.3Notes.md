## 2.3 Order By
An `ORDER BY` clause in a `SELECT` query tells how we would like the result set ordered. It is followed by a list of columns, left to right, and either ASC or DESC. (ASC is the default so you can leave it off)
* You CAN use column aliases (1,2,3) in the ```ORDER BY```.
* You CAN mix ```ASC``` and ```DESC```. 
* You CAN ```ORDER BY``` a column you didn't ```SELECT```.

### Example: Sorting using column aliases.
The items on the ```SELECT``` line can be referred to by their number, starting with 1.
```sql
SELECT lastname
FROM someTable
ORDER BY 1; -- here the "1" refers to the "lastname" column (and ASC is assumed default)
```
The items on the ```SELECT``` line can be referred to by their number, starting with 1.
```sql
SELECT lastname, birthdate
FROM someTable
ORDER BY 1, 2; -- 1=lastname, 2=birthdate
```

### Example: Sorting by a column we didn't select.
```sql
SELECT lastname
FROM someTable
ORDER BY firstname DESC; -- here I sort by a column that I didn't select (firstname) and I put the results in reverse-order
```

### Example: Sorting by two different things in two different orders, using aliases, and one thing we didn't select:
```sql
SELECT lastname, firstname
FROM someTable
ORDER BY 1 ASC, 2 DESC, middlename ASC; -- here we use aliases, non-selected column, and mix orders ASC/DESC
```
