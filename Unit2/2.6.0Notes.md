## 2.6 Aggregate Functions
Aggregate functions include `min()`, `max()`, `avg()`, `sum()`, `stdev()`, and my personal favorite `count()`. The word "aggregate" means "collection" or "to collect".

### 2.6.0 Simple aggregates
To apply the aggregate function, just call it on a column name, like this:
```sql
SELECT count(SpokenLanguage)
FROM CountryLanguage;
```
The result of a simple count is just a number.

Here are some other ways to use aggregate queries. 
#### Example: 
```sql
SELECT max(Population)
FROM Country;
```
#### Example:
```sql
SELECT min(IndepYear)
FROM Country;
```
You can also add an alias to make the display of an aggregate function look nicer:
```sql
SELECT count(Continent) as 'total number of continents'
FROM Country;
```
And reduce the number of duplicates being counted: 
```sql
SELECT count(DISTINCT Continent) as 'total number of continents'
FROM Country;
```
