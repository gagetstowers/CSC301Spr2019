## 1.3. More About Data Types
The information from this section is specific to MySQL, our RDBMS environment for this course, but much of it will translate to other RDBMS as well.
### 1.3.1 Numeric Types
[MySQL numeric types documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/numeric-types.html)
#### 1.3.1.1 INTEGER or INT - whole numbers
* Don't worry about the "length" field here. [An integer is always the same size](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5634104/what-is-the-size-of-column-of-int11-in-mysql-in-bytes), the "length" is just for display purposes. There are also other sizes of integers that take up more or less memory.
* Not all numeric data values need to be integers. Consider a ZIP code. Those are numbers, but do we need the memory of an INTEGER to store them? A CHAR(5) might be a better choice.
* TINYINT = 1 byte (8 bit)
* SMALLINT = 2 bytes (16 bit)
* MEDIUMINT = 3 bytes (24 bit)
* INT = 4 bytes (32 bit)
* BIGINT = 8 bytes (64 bit)

#### 1.3.1.2 DECIMAL - numbers with decimal points
These are numbers with decimal points. They have parentheses after them, and inside the parens are two things: precision first and scale second. Example:

```sql
salary DECIMAL(5,2)
```
In this example, 5 is the precision, or total number of digits allowed in the number. 2 is the scale, or number of digits that go on the right of the decimal point. Therefore, for this example:

* 999.56 - is allowed
* 111.11 - is allowed
* 1000.56 - is disallowed (too many digits total)
* 1000.599 - is disallowed (too many digits on the right)

All number types are inserted with NO quotation marks around them. Example:
```sql
INSERT INTO mytable (salary) VALUES (199.99);
```
If you accidentally type quotation marks when inserting numeric data into a numeric column, the database will probably be okay with that (it will ignore them).

### 1.3.2 String Types
[MySQL String Type Documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/string-types.html)

All string types are inserted with quotation marks around the values. Example:
```sql
INSERT INTO mytable (myname) VALUES('Sally Smith');
```
or
```sql
INSERT INTO mytable (myname) VALUES("Sally Smith");
```
#### 1.3.2.1 Char - character data
This data type can hold any keyboard characters, as well as emojis and various world language characters also. 
A char data type is always a fixed length in the computer's storage, even if you type fewer characters. For example, if you set a field to be ```char(10)``` and then you only type 5 characters into the field, the value you typed will still be allotted 10 characters worth of memory.
> TIP:
> A character column needs a collation which tells us what the allowed language is, and alphabetical order is for that language. By default the collation is usually latin1-swedish-ci. ([Why](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6769901/why-is-mysqls-default-collation-latin1-swedish-ci)? 
> If you need to store a character set that is more complicated than latin1 characters (e.g. has emojis or multi-byte character sets), use a different collation. More about this in Unit 7.6.4.
#### 1.3.2.2 Varchar
* Short for "variable character". Varchars are just like chars, except that if they don't use up the entire reserved block, then the storage is freed.
* Various pronunciations are acceptable. I've heard all of the following: "vahr care", "vahr char", "vahr car", "vare care", "vare char", "vare car", and more. 
#### 1.3.2.3 Text
Text data type is used for larger strings. There are medium text and bigtext types also. Avoid blobs (**b**inary **l**arge **ob**jects) even though they are allowed in MySQL. The database is not very good at storing binary data such as pictures. A better solution would be to let the file system store binary objects and we just store the location in the database. [Read more about this.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3748/storing-images-in-db-yea-or-nay)
#### 1.3.2.4 Enum
Enumerated types are sort of like a set, or choosing an answer from a list. You specify the values you want to be allowed, and the user is only allowed to choose one of those. 
> Be aware that the order of the items in the ENUM creation is the sort order that you will get in an ```ORDER BY``` clause.
To add an ENUM in PhpMyAdmin, use the following structure in a ```CREATE``` statement:
```sql
ENUM('foo','bar','baz')
```
Those are single quotes and a comma in between.
In PhpMyAdmin, the interface wants you to fill it in like this:

### 1.3.3 Booleans
This is a kind of fake one; it just creates a tinyint where 0 is false and any other integer > 0 is true.
### 1.3.4 Date and Time data types
**Date** - for data formatted as YYYY-MM-DD like 2016-12-31. All three pieces (month, day, year) must be provided. The supported range is '1000-01-01' to '9999-12-31'.
**Time** - for data formatted as HH:mm:SS like 13:15:00. If you leave off the last 00, you are leaving off the seconds. '13:12' means '13:12:00', not '00:13:12'. 24 hour clock is used by default.
**Datetime** - for combined date and time in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS, like 2016-12-31 13:15:00. 
> TIP:
> You can set datetime types to automatically update themselves each time a record is touched by setting their default value to CURRENT_TIMESTAMP. This is useful for creating a "last updated" field. I use these a lot.
All date and time types are inserted with quotation marks around the, just like strings. Example:
```sql
INSERT INTO mytable (birthdate) VALUES('2002-12-15');
```
### 1.3.5 Other Things Relevant to Each Column
* **Name**: The name of the column. Avoid hyphens, spaces, and funky characters. Underscores are fine.
* **Length**: only relevant for character columns. The "length" of an integer column is irrelevant, so don't use it. 
* **Required/nullable**: is the column allowed to be empty (null)?
* **Auto_increment**: Upon ```INSERT```, a ```NULL``` value in the column will allow the database to automatically insert the next value. The database software itself will keep track of the next available value. Values are not re-used once deleted.
* **Primary Key (PK)**: Every row needs a unique identifier. This is called a Primary Key. We will learn more about these later in our Design unit, but for now, just know that each table will have one or more columns that comprise a Primary Key.

### 1.3.6 A word about quotation marks
* PhpMyAdmin will automatically insert \` (backquotes or backticks, located near the '1' key on the keyboard) around column names and table names
* We must use ' or " for string values
* Do not use ' or " around column names or table names
* Beware of smart quotes or curly quotes. So-called smart quotes look like this: ```“``` or ```”``` or ```’``` These are NOT Sql compliant and will cause you no end of headaches. Many times these are inserted after we copy/paste SQL code from somewhere on the web, or where we use a non-text editor for doing our work (e.g. Word or Google Docs) -- don't do it!

CORRECT:

```SELECT last_name FROM mytable WHERE first_name = 'Mary';``` (uses single quotes around data value)

```SELECT last_name FROM mytable WHERE first_name = "Mary";``` (uses double quotes around a data value)

```SELECT \`last_name\` FROM mytable WHERE first_name = 'Mary';``` (uses backticks around table name and single quotes around data value)

INCORRECT:

```SELECT last_name FROM mytable WHERE first_name = \`Mary\`;``` (uses backticks around a data value)

```SELECT last_name FROM 'mytable' WHERE first_name = 'Mary';``` (uses quotes around a table name)

```SELECT 'last_name' FROM mytable WHERE first_name = 'Mary';``` (uses quotes around a column name)
