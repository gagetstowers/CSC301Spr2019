## 1.2. Database Vocabulary 
* Using the correct vocabulary is important. It helps us to be Accurate and Efficient (two of our values from the prior section!)
* Experts in any topic use specialized vocabulary (sometimes derisively called "jargon") to convey information and have a richer conversation than non-experts can understand
* The following vocabulary words are particular to relational database systems.
### 1.2.1 Database
* A **database** is a collection of information that goes together in some logical way
* For example, we could imagine a database for information about Elon University. Things we might track in this database would be people (students, professors, staff members), courses taught, buildings, finances, and so on.
* New databases can be created by issuing a special database command (a SQL ```CREATE``` command, to be precise) directly to the database. These commands can be typed into an interface, or issued programmatically via a language like Python.
* Database software, such as MySQL, usually is installed on a computer (sometimes a remote server) and you access it through some kind of interface. In this class, our database software MySQL is installed on a machine called grid8.cs.elon.edu and we access that through a PhpMyAdmin interface at the following URL: https://grid8.cs.elon.edu/PhpMyAdmin 
* Sometimes a database is called a **schema**. In PhpMyAdmin you have various **schemas** in the left-hand pane, including one named after yourself.
### 1.2.2 SQL
* We issue commands to the database in order to make new databases, make new tables, add data, manipulate the data, delete data, and so on. 
* The most common language for talking to a relational database in this way is called **SQL**: structured query language
* SQL is pronounced either "S-Q-L" or "Sequel". You must never, ever say "squeal" because that's just silly. üê∑
* SQL is a declarative language which relies on commands. Commands include ``` SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, ALTER``` (there are more, but these are the main ones).
* Standard SQL has no inherent ability to do much logic (for example "if" statements); logic must be handled in separate programming languages or via add-ons to the language.
### 1.2.3 Table 
* A **table** is the main structure inside a relational database 
* Tables store data that is similar to each other. For example, we could imagine inside the Elon University database, we might have a table of students and a different table of courses.
* I like to think of these tables as storing "nouns" - each table describes one "noun"
* Synonyms for "table" are: entity, relation (hence the term 'relational' database management systems, or RDBMS)
* Similarly to how we create entire databases, new tables can be created using the point-and-click interface, such as PhpMyAdmin, or by using the SQL ```CREATE``` command.
* To remove a table we use the ```DROP``` command.
### 1.2.4 Relational Database
* A relational database is one that is made up of **relations**, or tables. There are many other types of databases, but relational databases have become the most popular over the past 40 years. They are the primary database in use today, although non-relational or so-called "NoSQL" (Not Only SQL) databases are increasing in popularity and we will definitely learn about these in this course as well.
### 1.2.5 Row 
* Inside the tables are **rows**, sometimes called records.
* Each row or record is one instance of the noun being described by the table
* For example, in our imaginary Elon University database, inside the Students table, we might have a row for "Sally Smith" and another row for "Joe Johnson".
* New rows are added to a table using the SQL ```INSERT``` command.
* To remove a row we use the ```DELETE``` command
### 1.2.6 Column
* Each row is made up of at least one **column** describing something about that row
* For example, Elon University Students might include columns called "first name" and "last name" and "birthdate"
* Synonyms of column are: attribute, field
* Columns can be added to a new table at the time the table is created. Or, existing columns can be changed or removed using the SQL ```ALTER``` command.
### 1.2.7 Data 
* The **data values** are found inside a database table's rows.
* Sometimes the data values are referred to as "cell values" since they might remind us a little of the cells in a spreadsheet, in that they are found at the intersection of a column and a row.
* Our goal in database design is that data values should be atomic. **Atomic** means the data value can not be broken down any further and still remain logical. For example, "Name" can be broken into "first name" (Sally) and "last name" (Smith), but it is probably not necessary to break "first name" into its individual letters (S-A-L-L-Y).
* Having atomic data helps us keep the data correct, and reduces the risk of making data errors.
* Entire rows of data are added to the database using SQL's ```INSERT``` command, and individual data values can be changed using the ```UPDATE``` command.
### 1.2.8 Data Types
* Data types describe what kind of data values we have. (Is it a number or words? Is it a date or a number? Is it a lot of text or just one or two characters?)
* Data types are assigned on a column-by-column basis. All data entered into that column must match the data type specified.
* Assigning a data type to data helps us keep the data correct, reduces the risk of making data errors. 
* Example data types include int, decimal, date, enum, char, varchar, boolean, blob, etc. (See Unit 1.3 for more details on these)
* There are more data types than this, and they differ between the different DBMSs
* The data types of a column in a table can be changed using the SQL ```ALTER``` command.
* If you enter the wrong type of data into a column, you will either get an error or the data will be modified/changed/shortened to match what the database is expecting. These changes can be quite destructive and unexpected, so it's best to choose the correct data type for the data you have!
### 1.2.9 Relationships
* The tables in a database are usually logically connected to each other. These logical connections are called the relationships between the tables. 
* For example, Elon University students might be listed in their own table, and then we might have a table for dorm rooms (imagine it lists the dormitory building, the room number, how many people live in that room, and so on). We can use a relationship to connect students to dorm rooms.
* Sometimes we will see drawings/diagrams that express the relationships between tables by using boxes for the tables and lines for the relationships between them. This kind of drawing is called an ERD, or entity-relationship diagram.
### 1.2.10 Example
Here is an example of an ERD with some of these vocabulary words shown. Can you find the name of the database server? The database itself? The tables? The columns? The data types? The relationships?
![sample ERD](https://github.com/megansquire/CSC301Spr2019/blob/master/images/1.0.png?raw=true)

* `Recipe` is the name of the database
* `Recipes`, `recipe_classes` are examples of tables
* `RecipeClassID` is an example of a column
* `smallInt(6)` is a data type and length
* data values are not shown, but we can imagine that an example data value for `IngredientName` in the `Ingredients` table would be 'milk' or 'flour'
